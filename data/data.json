        "source": "The author mistakenly believed their ACT test was on a certain day and ended up wandering around an empty high school for about half an hour, trying to gain access. They eventually checked their test ticket, realizing the ACT was scheduled for the previous day, which explained the empty parking lot and locked school."

        "source": "At nine years old, the author had a hobby of catching bugs to keep in their front yard and had grown a sizeable grasshopper collection housed in a terrarium. On one occasion, they caught a prevalent praying mantis and placed it in the grasshopper terrarium. Some hours later, the author returned to find the praying mantis eating a wing, implying it may have killed and eaten the grasshoppers."},
